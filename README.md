# Double or Triple Dice
This is my Gr. 11 final Java project, a simple dice game. It's played with two or three dice at the user's choice. 
Rules, scoring and other game elements are all included!
To show my development process, I included a flowchart of my code, a GANTT chart and a test log when testing my program for bugs and errors.
